# Global World Indicators Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project is an interactive **Power BI dashboard** analyzing global economic, social, and health indicators for **190+ countries** using **real-time API data**. The dashboard provides insights into GDP, health expenditure, internet access, unemployment, poverty reduction, and environmental indicators over multiple years. It enables stakeholders to track trends, compare regions, and make data-driven decisions.

## Key Features
- **Real-time API Integration:** Connects to live data sources with automated refresh cycles for up-to-date insights.  
- **Data Transformation:** Processes and cleans **100k+ multi-year records** using Power Query and DAX.  
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Includes KPIs, trend charts, drill-down visuals, and comparative analysis for countries, regions, and income groups.  
- **Trend Analysis:** Tracks changes in socio-economic and health indicators over time.  
- **Insight Generation:** Supports decision-making for economic, health, and environmental policy planning.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI**: Dashboard development, data modeling, DAX formulas  
- **Python (Optional)**: Data preprocessing & API integration
